# Maven
This maven repository is used to store all of the files that aren't available on other maven repositories that we need for our projects.

## How to use
In order to use this repository in maven, include the following repository:

````XML
<repository>
    <id>tranxcraft-repo</id>
    <url>https://github.com/TranxCraft/Maven/raw/master/</url>
</repository>
````
    
You can then reference any of the dependancies that you need like you would otherwise.
